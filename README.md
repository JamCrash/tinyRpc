tinyrpc
=======

tinyrpc is a simple RPC library. The communication layer can be implemented with any network library. 

Currently, we suport ASIO and ZeroMQ as the network layer.

Current implementation uses C++14, so you need a new compiler to compile the code.

Tested on both Linux and Windows (Visual Studio 2017).

Programming interface
=======

```c++
// define protocol
class RPC_Protocol : public ProtocolWithUID<UniqueId("RPC_Proto")> {
public:
    ComplexType req;
    size_t resp;

    virtual void MarshallRequest(StreamBuffer & buf) {
        req.Serialize(buf);
    }

    virtual void MarshallResponse(StreamBuffer & buf) {
        Serialize(buf, resp);
    }

    virtual void UnmarshallRequest(StreamBuffer & buf) {
        req.Deserialize(buf);
    }

    virtual void UnmarshallResponse(StreamBuffer & buf) {
        Deserialize(buf, resp);
    }

    virtual void HandleRequest(void *server) {
        // as a demonstration, this protocol returns req.x + req.y + req.z.size(),
        // and adds this value to server, which is just a std::atomic<size_t>
        std::atomic<size_t>* s = static_cast<std::atomic<size_t>*>(server);
        resp = req.x + (size_t)req.y + req.z.size();
        // note that the handler can be executed by multiple threads at the same time,
        // we need to make it thread-safe
        s->fetch_add(resp);
        TINY_WARN("Server is now %lu", s->load());
    }
};

    // start server
    // ...
    std::atomic<size_t> size = 0;
    rpc.RegisterProtocol<RPC_Protocol>(&size);
    rpc.StartServing();

    // now, create a client
    AsioEP ep(asio::ip::address::from_string("127.0.0.1"), port);
    RPC_Protocol proto;
    proto.req.x = 10;
    proto.req.y = 1.0;
    proto.req.z = "12345";
    ec = rpc.RpcCall(ep, proto);
    std::cout << "response = " << proto.resp << std::endl;
```

Contributing
=======
Everyone is welcome to contribute to this project, either to improve the code or documentation.

The whole library can be divided into these parts:

* tinyrpc.h: contains TinyRPCStub class, which is the entry point

* serialize.h: implements the Serializer template class

* tinycomm.h: declares the communication layer, which can be implemented with any network libray, such as asio (as in comm_asio.h), ZeroMQ, etc.

* other stuff: incluing logging, message structure, buffer, concurrent queue, unique id, ...

I will try to write as much document as possible in the files, but you are also welcome to contribute standalone document files.
